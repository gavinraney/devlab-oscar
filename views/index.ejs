    <h2 class = "subHeading"> A little about git </h2>
    <p>git is fast and easy version control software that makes projects between devs fast and efficient.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Branching and merging, meaning you can have mulitple local instances of branches that are entirely independant of each other</li>
        <li>As mentioned, git is fast, nearly all operations are done locally, giving it huge speeds on a centralized system which needs to communicate with a server elsewhere.</li>
        <li>git is mostly done from the command line, but IDE's have it built in for the most part such as VS code, which simplifies most everything.</li>
        <li>git is distributed, which means instead of doing a checkout, you can just clone the entire project. </li>
    </ul>
